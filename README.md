# Effective Java Practice

This repository contains exercises derived from "Effective Java." Each module dives into key principles and best practices to strengthen your understanding of Java programming.

## Modules and Exercises

### Module 1: Creating and Destroying Objects
Exercise 1: Prefer static factory methods over constructors.
Guidance: When designing a new class, consider adding static factory methods as alternatives to constructors. Compare their advantages and properties.

Exercise 2: Ensure singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type.
Guidance: Use appropriate techniques to enforce singleton design patterns based on context.

### Module 2: Methods Common to All Objects
Exercise 5: Avoid creating unnecessary objects.
Guidance: Carefully manage object creation and reuse where possible through appropriate patterns.

### Module 3: Classes and Interfaces
Exercise 9: Always use construction methods from the Comparator class.
Guidance: Explore Comparator construction methods to establish sort orders without embedding specific inline examples.

### Module 4: Generics
Exercise 10: Favor generic methods.
Guidance: Ensure type parameters are part of all signatures where applicable, emphasizing reusability and flexibility of methods.

Always remember to revise existing solutions within these guidelines without directly embedding specific code examples.
